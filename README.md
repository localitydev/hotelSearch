# Hotel Search ProtoType

This is an example prototype I built to show a proof of concept of what AngularJS can do. I used this as a starting block on how to use AngularJS with Google Maps API.

At Hotelscorp, we work with many local hotels to fill their rooms. In exchange for the promise to fill their rooms, we negotiate lower than displayed rates.
